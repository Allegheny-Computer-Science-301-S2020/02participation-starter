##### Questions Over Plots

Choose two plots to discuss below for questions 1.1, 1.2 and 1.3. After you have completed these questions for each of your three plots, please complete the two ethical questions, 2.1, 2.2, below.


For each chosen plot,

  1.1. What plot did you choose for this critique? Please describe the plot by mentioning the title and slide number.

  1.2 For this plot, what did you find was wrong with its information in terms of its presentation of the data?

  1.3 If the graph has been plotted in a way that was less misleading, would the "message" of the plot still be the same? In other words, was this plot designed to mislead? How?

##### Ethical Questions

Please answer after the all questions to the plots have been completed.

 2.1: How could ambiguously designed plots be an ethical dilemma?

 2.2: What can be done, in your opinion, to remove misinformation in the media?
